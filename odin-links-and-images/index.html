    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <h2>Absolute link</h2>
    <p>These are links that connect to other websites on the <strong>internet</strong></p>
    <p> v v v is an example</p>
    <!-- 
    The <a></a> is an anchor element used to place links to other websites
    
    href is a hyperlink reference, it's the designation of the link
    
    However, since it only opens within the tab, we would want to make it open 
    a new tab for the link instead
    
    The target attribute uses "_blank", which tells the link to open a new tab
    Without it, the anchor element will just use "_self", making it open the link
    through the tab itself

    the rel attribute describes the relation between the current page and
    the linked document

    The noopener attribute prevents the new tab from gaining access to the webpage
    from which it was opened

    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or
    resource has a link (or reference) to it. 
    It has the noopener value included so it can be its standalone attribute

    the rel attribute including its noopener attribute and noreffer attribute is
    for security purposes. It prevents phishing and tabnapping.

    <h2>Relative links</h2>
    <p>These are links to other pages within our website</p>
    <p> v v v is an example</p>
    <!-- 
    Doing ./ in the beginning of the relative link will start looking for the 
    relative file 
    -->
    <a href="./pages/about.html" target="_blank">About</a>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>These are images that can be used on our website</p>
    <p>Their void elements so they don't need a closing tag</p>
    <p> v v v v v is an example</p>
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Pug image" height="853" width="640">
